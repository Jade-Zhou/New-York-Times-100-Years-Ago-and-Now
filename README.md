# Project: Sentiment Analysis of the New York Times Archive

In this project, I have done sentiment analysis using the New York Times archive in November 1919 and 2019.

The archives are collected using the New York Times archive API, which can return an array of NYT articles for a given month. More detailed introduction of this API can be accessed [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview).

To use this API, you will need to create an account at https://developer.nytimes.com and register an app to create your own API key.
(You can follow the instructions [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started).) You will also need to save your API key in the .Rprofile file to reproduce my work.

Sentiment analysis is completed using R. Packages used in this project include `ggwordcloud` and `tidytext`.

The Rmd file can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jade-Zhou/New-York-Times-100-Years-Ago-and-Now/blob/main/Text%20analysis.Rmd).

The output can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jade-Zhou/New-York-Times-100-Years-Ago-and-Now/blob/main/Text-analysis.md).
